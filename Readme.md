# Marriott UALC Statistics and EBSCO Deletions Code #

This code is intended for use in specific statistics-gathering and record deletion tasks, and does not work unless strict file formatting conventions are followed. It also was not written with the intention of long-term support, so it is somewhat inflexible, though with fairly minimal effort it could be expanded upon to handle a wider variety of tasks.

Please read the directions at the top of each .py file carefully. If you want to test the programs, a zip file (Example Files.zip) is provided. If you unzip the files from the zip file and place them in the same folder as the .py files, you can run the example commands found in each .py file (at the end of each fileâ€™s header comments) to produce sample results. Ensure that your input files are formatted EXACTLY like the example files when you use these programs to process actual data.
